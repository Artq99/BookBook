# BookBook
A simple program to keep track of books you want to read, you have read and to pick a random one from you list in case you cannot make up your mind.

**For now, this program is available only in Polish version.**

If you love books just like me, you have probably come across a problem that you could not remember the title of this book you had promised yourself to read when you had been in a book store last time. Or maybe you have a list, your personal pile of shame, but when you are about to pick the next title to read, you cannot decide - there are too many of them!
This program solves both problems: here you can store your book list, mark the titles you have already read and you can randomly pick the next book from these you have not.

## Features

* Adding, editing and removing books
* Saving a list as a database
* Showing the most important statistics of the book list (the percentage of read and unread books)
* Picking random titles from the list
